## Marketing Data analysis
In thisdata analysis project, I focused on marketing data to derive valuable insights. I began by meticulously cleaning the dataset and enhancing its quality through strategic feature engineering. Subsequently, I employed the powerful tools offered by the `sklearn` library to preprocess the data effectively, ensuring it was ready for advanced techniques.

One significant step was dimensionality reduction, where I harnessed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to condense the dataset's complexity while retaining its essential characteristics. This expedited subsequent analysis and improved model efficiency. Finally, I employed KMeans clustering to partition the data into distinct customer segments based on underlying patterns. This segmentation not only provided a deeper understanding of customer behavior but also laid the groundwork for targeted marketing strategies.By meticulously navigating through data cleaning, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, this project showcases my adeptness in utilizing key data science techniques to unveil actionable insights from marketing data.

## Car price prediction
In my data science project focused on predicting car prices, I followed a structured methodology to enhance model efficacy. Initially, I performed data cleansing by removing outliers and addressing null values to ensure data integrity. Acknowledging the intricate, non-linear interplay between independent and dependent variables, I applied logarithmic transformation to foster improved linearity and stability.



Concurrently, I engaged in feature engineering, meticulously curating and creating pertinent features that contributed meaningfully to explaining the variance in car prices. This strategic process substantially bolstered the model's predictive prowess. To establish uniformity and mitigate bias arising from different scales, I standardized the dataset, harmonizing the impact of all variables.

Employing a linear regression model accuracy = 85.57%

I harnessed the power of the pre-processed data to offer invaluable insights into the intricate relationships underpinning feature influence on car prices. Rigorous testing validated the model's accuracy, gauging its performance against previously unseen data. The resulting outcome is a robust predictive framework distinguished by heightened accuracy, underpinned by meticulous data preprocessing, transformative techniques, astute feature engineering, and adept model calibration.

## Sales data analysis
In my sales data analysis project, I followed a structured approach to extract valuable insights. Initially, I addressed data quality by eliminating null values. Then, I engaged in feature engineering to enhance the dataset's information richness. To derive meaningful insights, I employed visualizations, leveraging the groupby function to connect customer behavior and day of the week, revealing peak sales days.



Further, I employed the Facebook Prophet tool to perform sales forecasting. This involved utilizing historical data trends and seasonality patterns to create accurate predictions about future sales performance. Through these steps, I not only ensured data integrity but also provided actionable insights into customer behavior and future sales trends. My approach showcases a comprehensive understanding of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling techniques, all of which are crucial for effective data-driven decision-making.
